## About the Project

The “Modern Stopwatch” project is a lightweight, browser-based stopwatch tool featuring start, reset, and lap-recording functionality.  
It offers a responsive and minimal UI so users can track elapsed time quickly and accurately without distractions.  
This project helped me practise DOM manipulation, event handling, and clean UI design.

## Features

- ✅ Start / Pause timer  
- ✅ Reset timer to 00:00:00  
- ✅ Lap functionality (record multiple lap times)  
- ✅ Clean, minimal user interface — easy to read timer  
- ✅ Responsive layout — works across devices (desktop / mobile)  

---

## Built With

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (for styling and layout)  
- JavaScript (for stopwatch logic and DOM manipulation)  

---

## Usage

To run the stopwatch locally:

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.  
3. Use the buttons: **Start** to begin the timer; **Reset** to set back to 0; **Lap** to record the current time.  
4. (Optional) You can host the files on any static hosting platform — e.g. GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel — to make the stopwatch available online.
